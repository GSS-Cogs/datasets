# Integrated Data Service Dissemination - Datasets
These cubish CSV-W datasets are stored on Github on behalf of other governments or government departments. They are ingested into the Integrated Data Service's [DataExplorer](https://beta.gss-data.org.uk).

This README is manually maintained.

The structure is essentially a mono-repo for ad hoc datasets where there is not an intent to keep this data around forever, or to fulfill a specific purpose.

There are two datasets which support the work of the [climate change](https://climate-change.data.gov.uk) portal, which cover the same topic for England and Wales.

* DEFRA's flood defence spending for England
* The Welsh Government's flood defence allocation for Wales

Real terms figures are shown in 20/21 prices, using HM Treasuryâ€™s GDP Deflator (June 2021 publication)
